    "## Code Planning\n",
    "* I have attempted to modularize and parametrize the code as much as possible to reduce complexity and make it easy to tune hyperparameters\n",
    "* I have used 3 Classes:\n",
    "  1. **Class HyperParameter** : is used to maintain hyperparameters used by functions. This makes it easy to tune the        parameters on the fly without any chane in the code\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. **Class Save_Images** : is used to save all the images generated, initially in this dictionary and then in a            pickle file. Saving it in pickle file gives advanatage to view the o/p images for analysis/debugging without          rerunning the program \n",
    "\n",
    "  3. **Class Line** : \n",
    "       This class is used to maintain information about lane detection and curvature. This information can be used to        average the curvature points to determine the next starting points for lane detection\n",
    "\n",
    "* The code is divided in:\n",
    "  1. Helper Functions - Modularize repeated code\n",
    "  2. Main Functions  - These functions form the main Pipeline\n",
    "  3. Testing Function - These functions are use to run the pipeline on Test images\n",
    "  4. Production Function - These function forms the main Pipeline to run against the real video\n",
    "  5. Visualization - Save Images in Dictionry and then to Pickle files for later debugging and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-1-A:  Camera Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "calibration steps:\n",
    "1. Identify 15-20 images for calibration- Here we use chessboard images\n",
    "2. Decide the number of corners of the chessboard per row (nx=9) and per column (ny=6) to be identified\n",
    "3. Create object points using np.mgrid\n",
    "4. Read each calibration image and use **cv2.findChessboardCorners** to detect the required (nx, ny) corners\n",
    "5. These corners will form on set of Image points - \n",
    "6. For every image, collect the image points and make copy of the object points in two seperate list\n",
    "7. Pass this list of image points and object points to **cv2.calibrateCamera**\n",
    "8. **cv2.calibrateCamera** then returns the Camera Matrix and Distortion cooefficients which will be then used to undistort any image\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "1. **cv2.drawChessboardCorners** CV function has no direct contribution to calibration but it helps visually to determine if the detected corners are correct or no\n",
    "2. For Images which do not have the needed (nx, ny) corners, **cv2.findChessboardCorners** will not return success.\n",
    "3. Those images are good to test how good the calibration is performed on the iamges by the calibration Matrix.\n",
